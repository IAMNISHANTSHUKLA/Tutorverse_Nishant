# TutorVerse üöÄüìö

TutorVerse is a friendly and interactive AI-powered learning assistant designed to help students explore the wonders of Math and Physics. It features a multi-agent system where a main Tutor Agent routes queries to specialized Math and Physics sub-agents.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Interactive Chat Interface**: Users can ask questions in natural language.
*   **AI-Powered Responses**: Leverages Genkit and Google's Gemini models to provide explanations and solutions.
*   **Multi-Agent Architecture**:
    *   **Tutor Agent (Main)**: Recognizes user intent (Math, Physics, or other).
    *   **Math Agent (Sub-Agent)**: Specializes in math-related questions, equipped with a calculator tool for arithmetic operations.
    *   **Physics Agent (Sub-Agent)**: Specializes in physics-related questions, equipped with a tool to look up physical constants.
*   **Child-Friendly UI**: Designed with a cheerful and engaging theme (Teal, Light Yellow, Orange).
*   **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes.
*   **Built with Modern Tech**: Utilizes Next.js, React, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind CSS.
*   **No Authentication Required**: Simplified access for ease of use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd tutorverse
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Google AI API Key for Genkit (CRITICAL FOR AI FEATURES)**:
    *   Genkit requires access to a Google AI model (like Gemini) for its AI capabilities.
    *   **Crucially, you MUST set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.** The application's AI features (`src/ai/genkit.ts`) are configured to read this key from the environment.
    *   **How to set the `GOOGLE_API_KEY`**:
        1.  Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create an API key if you don't have one.
        2.  **In Firebase Studio (or your deployment environment):** Find the section for setting environment variables (often called "Environment Variables," "Secrets," or "Configuration"). Add a new variable:
            *   **Name**: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
            *   **Value**: `your_google_ai_api_key_from_ai_studio` (Paste your actual key here)
        3.  **For Local Development (outside Firebase Studio):** Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project (if it doesn't exist) and add:
            ```env
            GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_from_ai_studio
            ```
        4.  **Important**: After setting this environment variable (either in Firebase Studio or locally), you **MUST restart or redeploy** your application for the change to take effect.

## ‡∂∞ Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server (Next.js)**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will usually be available at `http://localhost:9002` (as per your `package.json`).

2.  **Start the Genkit Development Server (Optional, for Genkit UI/Inspector)**:
    If you want to use the Genkit developer UI to inspect flows, traces, etc., run this in a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or
    # npm run genkit:watch (for auto-reloading on Genkit file changes)
    ```
    The Genkit UI is typically available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## üß† Multi-Agent Architecture

The core AI functionality is built around a multi-agent system:

*   **Main Tutor Agent (`src/app/actions.ts`)**: Receives the user's query and uses an intent recognition flow (`src/ai/flows/recognize-intent.ts`) to determine if the query is related to "math," "physics," or "other."
*   **Math Agent (`src/ai/flows/generate-math-response.ts`)**: Handles math questions. It uses a `calculatorTool` to perform arithmetic calculations.
*   **Physics Agent (`src/ai/flows/generate-physics-explanation.ts`)**: Handles physics questions. It uses a `physicsConstantsTool` to look up values of physical constants.
*   **Orchestration**: The Tutor Agent delegates the query to the appropriate specialist agent and returns the response to the user.

## üé® UI and Styling

*   The UI is built with **ShadCN UI** components, providing a set of accessible and customizable building blocks.
*   Styling is primarily handled by **Tailwind CSS**, with a custom theme defined in `src/app/globals.css`.
*   The color scheme is designed to be child-friendly:
    *   Background: Light Yellow (`#FFFFE0`)
    *   Primary: Cheerful Teal (`#008080`)
    *   Accent: Bright Orange (`#FFA500`)

## üí° Genkit

This project uses **Genkit**, an open-source framework from Google, to build AI-powered features. Genkit helps structure, run, and manage AI flows, making it easier to integrate with language models like Gemini. Key Genkit files include:

*   `src/ai/genkit.ts`: Initializes and configures Genkit with the Google AI plugin. **It expects the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to be set as an environment variable.**
*   `src/ai/flows/`: Contains the definitions for different AI flows (e.g., intent recognition, math response, physics explanation).
*   `src/ai/dev.ts`: Used for local Genkit development (e.g., starting the Genkit developer UI).
