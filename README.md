## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd tutorverse
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Firebase Setup**:
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project or use an existing one.
    *   In your project, go to **Project Settings** > **General**.
    *   Under "Your apps", click the Web icon (`</>`) to add a new web app.
    *   Register your app and Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object.
    *   **Important**: The project currently uses a hardcoded Firebase configuration in `src/lib/firebase/config.ts`. For a production setup or better security, you should ideally move these to environment variables. If you wish to use environment variables:
        *   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project.
        *   Add your Firebase configuration keys:
            ```env
            NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
            NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
            NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
            NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
            NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
            NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
            ```
    *   **Enable Google Sign-In**:
        *   In the Firebase Console, go to **Authentication** (under Build in the left sidebar).
        *   Go to the **Sign-in method** tab.
        *   Click on **Google** in the list of providers.
        *   Enable the Google provider and provide a project support email.
        *   Click **Save**.

4.  **Google AI API Key for Genkit**:
    *   Genkit requires access to a Google AI model (like Gemini). You'll need an API key for this.
    *   Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create an API key.
    *   Set this API key as an environment variable. Create/update your `.env` or `.env.local` file in the root of your project:
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
        ```
    *   Note: The `genkit` object in `src/ai/genkit.ts` is configured to use `googleAI()`. This plugin will automatically look for the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.

## ‡∂∞ Running the Application

1.  **Start the Development Server (Next.js)**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will usually be available at `http://localhost:9002` (as per your `package.json`).

2.  **Start the Genkit Development Server (Optional, for Genkit UI/Inspector)**:
    If you want to use the Genkit developer UI to inspect flows, traces, etc., run this in a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or
    # npm run genkit:watch (for auto-reloading on Genkit file changes)
    ```
    The Genkit UI is typically available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## üß† Multi-Agent Architecture

The core AI functionality is built around a multi-agent system:

*   **Main Tutor Agent (`src/app/actions.ts`)**: Receives the user's query and uses an intent recognition flow (`src/ai/flows/recognize-intent.ts`) to determine if the query is related to "math," "physics," or "other."
*   **Math Agent (`src/ai/flows/generate-math-response.ts`)**: Handles math questions. It uses a `calculatorTool` to perform arithmetic calculations.
*   **Physics Agent (`src/ai/flows/generate-physics-explanation.ts`)**: Handles physics questions. It uses a `physicsConstantsTool` to look up values of physical constants.
*   **Orchestration**: The Tutor Agent delegates the query to the appropriate specialist agent and returns the response to the user.

## üé® UI and Styling

*   The UI is built with **ShadCN UI** components, providing a set of accessible and customizable building blocks.
*   Styling is primarily handled by **Tailwind CSS**, with a custom theme defined in `src/app/globals.css`.
*   The color scheme is designed to be child-friendly:
    *   Background: Light Yellow (`#FFFFE0`)
    *   Primary: Cheerful Teal (`#008080`)
    *   Accent: Bright Orange (`#FFA500`)

## üí° Genkit

This project uses **Genkit**, an open-source framework from Google, to build AI-powered features. Genkit helps structure, run, and manage AI flows, making it easier to integrate with language models like Gemini. Key Genkit files include:

*   `src/ai/genkit.ts`: Initializes and configures Genkit with the Google AI plugin.
*   `src/ai/flows/`: Contains the definitions for different AI flows (e.g., intent recognition, math response, physics explanation).
*   `src/ai/dev.ts`: Used for local Genkit development (e.g., starting the Genkit developer UI).
