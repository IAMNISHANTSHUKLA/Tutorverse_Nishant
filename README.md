## Multi-Agent Architecture Design & Principles

TutorVerse is built upon a multi-agent architecture, drawing inspiration from design principles seen in frameworks like Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and similar systems. This approach emphasizes modularity, specialized expertise, and tool utilization.

### Agent Composition & Communication (Orchestration)

- **Main Agent (Tutor Agent)**: The primary interface for the user is the Tutor Agent, implemented within `src/app/actions.ts` (specifically the `processUserQuery` function). It receives the student's natural language query.

- **Intent Recognition**: The Tutor Agent first communicates with an **Intent Recognition Agent** (the `recognizeIntent` flow in `src/ai/flows/recognize-intent.ts`). This specialized agent analyzes the query to determine its subject matter (e.g., "math," "physics," or "other").

- **Delegation to Specialist Sub-Agents**: Based on the recognized intent, the Tutor Agent intelligently delegates the query to the appropriate specialist sub-agent:
  - **Math Agent**: Handles math-related questions (the `generateMathResponse` flow in `src/ai/flows/generate-math-response.ts`).
  - **Physics Agent**: Handles physics-related questions (the `generatePhysicsExplanation` flow in `src/ai/flows/generate-physics-explanation.ts`).

This hierarchical structure demonstrates agent composition, where the main agent orchestrates various sub-capabilities. Communication paths are clearly defined for query routing and response aggregation.

### Tool Utilization by Specialist Agents

A core principle of effective AI agents is their ability to use tools to augment their capabilities.

- The **Math Agent** utilizes a `calculatorTool` to perform arithmetic calculations. This allows it to solve mathematical expressions accurately or verify steps in a problem-solving process.
- The **Physics Agent** employs a `physicsConstantsTool` to look up values of common physical constants (e.g., speed of light, Planck constant). This ensures accuracy and enriches its explanations.
- Genkit's `ai.defineTool(...)` is used to define these tools, which are then made available to the respective agent prompts, enabling the LLM to decide when and how to use them.

### Modularity & Specialization

- Each agent (intent recognizer, math expert, physics expert) and their tools are encapsulated in separate, modular files (primarily within the `src/ai/flows/` directory).
- This promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the system easier to understand, maintain, and extend. For example, a new subject expert (e.g., a Chemistry Agent) could be added with minimal disruption to existing agents.
- Genkit's `ai.defineFlow(...)` helps structure these individual agent capabilities.

This architecture allows TutorVerse to handle diverse queries effectively by routing them to agents with the specific knowledge and tools required for the task.

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd tutorverse
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Google AI API Key for Genkit (CRITICAL FOR AI FEATURES)**:
   
   Genkit requires access to a Google AI model (like Gemini) for its AI capabilities.
   
   **Current Setup (Development/Prototyping Only - API Key Hardcoded)**: The `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is currently hardcoded in `src/ai/genkit.ts`. This is done to simplify initial setup in environments where setting environment variables might be challenging. The specific key used is `AIzaSyBfJLoyQHy0NnxTSYQMOwV9D9eKbFY_xwc`.
   
   **SECURITY WARNING**: **For any production deployment or if sharing this code, you MUST remove the hardcoded API key and use environment variables.**
   
   **Recommended Setup (for Production/Secure Use)**:
   
   1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to create an API key if you don't have one.
   
   2. **Remove the hardcoded `apiKey` option** from `googleAI(...)` in `src/ai/genkit.ts`. The Genkit `googleAI` plugin will automatically look for `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the environment.
   
   3. **In Firebase Studio (or your deployment environment):** Find the section for setting environment variables (often called "Environment Variables," "Secrets," or "Configuration"). Add a new variable:
      - **Name**: `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
      - **Value**: `your_google_ai_api_key_from_ai_studio` (Paste your actual key here)
   
   4. **For Local Development (outside Firebase Studio):** Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project (if it doesn't exist) and add:
      ```env
      GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key_from_ai_studio
      ```
   
   5. **Important**: After setting this environment variable (either in Firebase Studio or locally), you **MUST restart or redeploy** your application for the change to take effect.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Development Server (Next.js)**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
   The application will usually be available at `http://localhost:9002` (as per your `package.json`).

2. **Start the Genkit Development Server (Optional, for Genkit UI/Inspector)**:
   
   If you want to use the Genkit developer UI to inspect flows, traces, etc., run this in a separate terminal:
   ```bash
   npm run genkit:dev
   # or
   # npm run genkit:watch (for auto-reloading on Genkit file changes)
   ```
   The Genkit UI is typically available at `http://localhost:4000`.

## UI and Styling

- The UI is built with **ShadCN UI** components, providing a set of accessible and customizable building blocks.
- Styling is primarily handled by **Tailwind CSS**, with a custom theme defined in `src/app/globals.css`.
- The color scheme is designed to be child-friendly:
  - Background: Light Yellow (`#FFFFE0`)
  - Primary: Cheerful Teal (`#008080`)
  - Accent: Bright Orange (`#FFA500`)

## Genkit

This project uses **Genkit**, an open-source framework from Google, to build AI-powered features. Genkit helps structure, run, and manage AI flows, making it easier to integrate with language models like Gemini. Key Genkit files include:

- `src/ai/genkit.ts`: Initializes and configures Genkit with the Google AI plugin.
- `src/ai/flows/`: Contains the definitions for different AI flows (e.g., intent recognition, math response, physics explanation).
- `src/ai/dev.ts`: Used for local Genkit development (e.g., starting the Genkit developer UI).
